Evasion is now better reflected in the ship stat. Previously, evasion was not included when calculating ship defense stat. This caused ships with high evasions are underrated in defense stat - and they are harder to beat when you are matched with them. This patch should correct this bias and hopefully make matchmaking more fair.

Bugfix:
- Fix a bug where friendship bonus are not granted when a friendship is auto renewed
- Fix a bug where SS Majestic's blueprint has disconnected modules
