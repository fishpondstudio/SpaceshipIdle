Done:
- Add an option to only show chat messages on hover - this will be the default option and free up lots of space on the bottom left corner
- Evasion Cluster / Recovery Cluster / Damage Cluster / HP Cluster now only require the same type of weapon (i.e. autocannons, missiles, etc), no longer need to be the exact same model
- Add an option to hide XP production per cycle popup text
- SS Intrepid's unique bonus is changed to: Add two D6 dice rolls to Peace Treaty Score when negotiating war reparation
- Slightly reduce the time warp from friendship bonus
